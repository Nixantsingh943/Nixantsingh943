### ⚡ A Little About Me ("The Origin Story")
> 🧬 Once bitten by a radioactive semicolon, I gained superpowers in code.  
Now I build **awesome stuff**, break things (on purpose), and live on the edge of deployment! 

- 🌱 Currently growing: `{ skills: ["AI", "WebDev", "C++", "Web3"] }`
- 🔥 Currently building: A project that will either **change the world** or crash my computer 💥
- 🤔 Fun fact: I still Google "how to center a div" every. single. time.
- 📬 Reach me via pigeon or [social links below](#📫-catch-me-on-the-interwebs)

> And commit like you know what you’re doing.”
